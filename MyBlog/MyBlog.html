                    <h3><strong>About the Job</strong></h3>
                        <sec>Most people don't understand the difference between a <i style="color: blue;">Rodeo Clown</i> and a <i style="color: red;">Bullfighter.</i> Some guys in the industry get really particular about what they get called, but to me, it really doesn't matter.  Technically, I am a bullfighter, but I am going to explain a little about both and how they are different.
                            <h4 class="clown"><b>Rodeo Clown</b></h4>
                                <p>A rodeo clown is 95% entertainment.  He is the one telling jokes and walking around being a goofball.  What is the other five percent?  The last five percent is protection.  The rodeo clown can offer an island of protection.  Everyone notices his barrel he can jump in and get rolled around in.  Well, that isn't just for fun! That can be used as a decoy or tool for protection. </p>

                                <p>A bullfighter is the protector for the bullriders.  My job is to distract the bull! Sometimes riders fall off in a very bad spot and it is my job to be a better target for the bull.  Sometimes that means just jumping in and taking the hit or other times it's as simple as grabbing the bull's head and dictating his movements another direction so everyone is safe.</p>

                        <h3>Protective Equipment Explained</h3>
                            <p>The gear plays a critical role to my looks and performance.  The vest is designed to spread the point of impact out so it doesn't hurt as bad when I get hit.  The padded shorts are also supposed to help lessen the blow, but the bull never seems to hit where the pads are.  I have been very lucky to not have any knee problems yet, but I wear the DonJoy Defiance knee braces as a precautionary measure.  It is easier to replace a knee brace than my actual knee.  I have not ever had to use my hook knife, but I carry it just in case a bullrider would get a spur or something caught in a rope and I was forced to cut the rope to get him loose.</p>
                        <h3>Cosmetics Explained</h3>    
                            <p>The hat is an obvious one I think, most people know what a cowboy hat is.  I use Mehron clown makeup because it is a grease based paint and does not come off with just water and sweat! The baggies are a huge part in the looks of it all, but they also serve a purpose in protection. Bulls are attracted to movement and as big as the baggies are, they give me an extra inch or two for mistakes and the bull might hook those instead of me. </p>

                <h3><strong>Favorite Places</strong></h3>
                    <p>I have been very fortunate to be apart of great rodeos all over the United States! My top five places I like to go every year include:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong></li>
                                <p>I am a huge fan of the live music everywhere you go on the main drag!  It is filled with very friendly people and just a great atmosphere!  I would highly recommend visiting!</p>
                            <li><strong>Woodstown/Pilesgrove, New Jersey AKA Cowtown</strong></li>
                                <p>This place is my second home.  The family behind the oldest running PRCA rodeo in the nation are the most genuine and caring people! Check out the little video and see what this place is all about!</p>
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShiG062e6-o&ab_channel=YETI">Cowtown Rodeo</a> 
                            <li><strong>Raleigh, North Carolina</strong></li>
                                <p>Raleigh is in the top five because the rodeo is usually in late February or March and it's cold where I'm from so it's great to go somewhere warm for a few days.</p>
                            <li><strong>Park Rapids, Minnesota</strong> </li>
                                <p>I always enjoy this rodeo because the stands are usually packed and there is a live band playing great dancing music after.</p>
                            <li><strong>De Pere, Wisconsin</strong> </li>
                                <p>This town outside of Green Bay has a very fun little rodeo, but I have to admit what makes it so fun is the after party.  There is a little sports bar right across the street that has sand volleyball and sand dodgeball courts. It never fails that we have a cowboys versus the locals game and it gets wild! </p>
                        </ol>
